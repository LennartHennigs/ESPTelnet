Description
-----------
Use this library to set up a the telnet server to communicate status messages or debug / error log output. This is especially useful when you don't have a serial connection to the ESP.

It has been tested with ESP8266 and ESP32 devices.

How To Use
----------

__Definition__
- Use the `begin()` and `stop()` to start or stop the telnet server. 
- It needs an active WiFi connection or the ESP needs to be in softAP mode

- The telnet server only allows you to connect a single client to it. You can use `getIP()` to get the connected client's IP address.

__Callback Handlers__
- The library uses callback handlers to notify you of different telnet events
  - ```void onConnect(CallbackFunction f);```
  - ```void onConnectionAttempt(CallbackFunction f);```
  - ```void onReconnect(CallbackFunction f);```
  - ```void onDisconnect(CallbackFunction f);```
  - ```void onInputReceived(CallbackFunction f);```

- All callback functions need a String parameter. There the IP from the connected client is sen, or the input text in case of `onInputReceived()`.

__Output and Input__
- Via `print()` and `println()` you can output text on the telnet server.

- To receive and parse input from the telnet client you can add a handler via `onInputReceived()`.

- By default, the library waits for a newline character from the client, and sends data to the callback handler one line at a time. This behaviour can be turned off by calling `lineMode(false)`.

__Using it to Debug Code__    
- A common use case is to use it for debuging remote devices, where you might not have access to Serial. Thus I added a few macros to make debugging easier:

- To enable debugging you need to set `DEBUG_ON`
  ```#define DEBUG_ON 1```
- You can then define the output channels (serial and/or telnet)
  ```
  #define DEBUG_USE_SERIAL 1
  #define DEBUG_USE_TELNET 1
  ```

- After this you can use the following macros
  - `DEBUG_INFO` to see compilation the date & time of your sketch
  - `DEBUG_WHERE` to print where this message is located (file & line number)
  - `DEBUG_MSG(x)` to print a message
  - `DEBUG_VAR(...)` to print a variable value

- See the [DebugMacroExample](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/ESPTelnet/blob/master/examples/DebugMacroExample/DebugMacroExample.ino) for more details.

__The Loop__    
- For the class to work, you need to call the `loop()` member function in your sketch's `loop()` function.

    bool begin();
    void loop();
    void stop();

    void print(String str);
    void print(char c);
    void println(String str);

    void onInputReceived(CallbackFunction f);
```



Installation
------------
Open the Arduino IDE choose "Sketch > Include Library" and search for "ESPTelnet". 
Or download the ZIP archive (https://github.com/lennarthennigs/ESPTelnet/zipball/master), and choose "Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library..." and select the downloaded file.
